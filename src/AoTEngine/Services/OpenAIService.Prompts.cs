This is a CRITICAL attempt - previous attempts have failed. Take EXTRA CARE to ensure SUCCESS.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate COMPLETE, PRODUCTION-READY C# code with ALL necessary using statements
2. Ensure STRICT type compatibility across all references
3. Use EXACT namespace matching as specified
4. Implement ALL expected types with COMPLETE implementations
5. Follow C# best practices, SOLID principles, and modern .NET 9 patterns
6. Add comprehensive XML documentation comments for all public members
7. Include proper error handling and validation where appropriate
8. Ensure all dependency types are used EXACTLY as defined in their contracts
9. Verify all property types, method signatures, and return types are correct
10. Use nullable reference types appropriately for .NET 9

CODE QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Use async/await patterns correctly
- Implement IDisposable if managing resources
- Use modern C# features (records, pattern matching, etc.) where appropriate
- Ensure thread-safety if applicable
- Add defensive programming practices

CAREFULLY REVIEW your generated code for:
- Missing using directives
- Namespace mismatches
- Type incompatibilities
- Missing or incorrect member implementations
- Syntax errors
- Logic errors

This code will be validated automatically. ENSURE IT COMPILES and RUNS correctly.";

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- This is attempt #{attempt + 1} of {MaxRetries}
- Previous attempts had issues - review requirements carefully
- This code will be combined with other tasks for validation
- Ensure ALL types, namespaces, and references are EXACT and CORRECT

EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. Start with ALL necessary using directives (using System; using System.Collections.Generic; etc.)
2. Define the namespace EXACTLY as specified: {task.Namespace ?? "ProjectName.Feature"}
3. Implement ALL expected types: {string.Join(", ", task.ExpectedTypes)}
4. Use file-scoped namespaces (namespace ProjectName.Feature;)
5. Add XML documentation for all public members

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
// ... other using statements

namespace {task.Namespace ?? "ProjectName.Feature"};

/// <summary>
/// Description of the class
/// </summary>
public class YourClass

ROLE: You are tasked with FIXING code that failed validation, not rewriting it from scratch.

APPROACH:
1. Analyze the error messages to identify specific issues
2. Make MINIMAL, TARGETED changes to fix each error
3. Preserve the original code structure and intent
4. Do NOT rewrite the entire logic if only specific fixes are needed
5. Ensure fixes don't introduce new errors

REPAIR GUIDELINES:
- Fix syntax errors precisely at the problematic location
- Add missing using directives at the top of the file
- Correct type mismatches and namespace issues
- Fix missing or incorrect method signatures
- Maintain the original design pattern and architecture

Generate clean, efficient, and well-documented C# code.

This is the FINAL attempt - previous fixes have FAILED. Apply MAXIMUM PRECISION.

CRITICAL MISSION:
You must REPAIR the existing code to fix ALL validation errors. Do NOT rewrite from scratch.

REPAIR PROTOCOL:
1. ANALYZE: Carefully examine EACH error message to identify the root cause
2. LOCATE: Pinpoint the exact line/type/member causing each error  
3. FIX: Apply MINIMAL, TARGETED changes to resolve each specific issue
4. VERIFY: Ensure your fix doesn't break other parts of the code
5. PRESERVE: Maintain the original code structure, intent, and design

ERROR CATEGORIES TO ADDRESS:
- Missing using statements → Add at top of file
- Namespace mismatches → Correct the namespace declaration
- Type name errors → Fix spelling, casing, or full qualification
- Missing members → Add required properties, methods, or constructors
- Signature mismatches → Correct parameter types, return types
- Access modifier issues → Adjust public/private/protected
- Interface implementation → Implement all required members

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- ALL validation errors MUST be resolved
- The repaired code MUST compile successfully
- Maintain production-quality code
- Follow .NET 9 best practices
- Preserve original functionality and intent

Analyze the Error Log and modify the Failed Code to fix these SPECIFIC issues:
- Maintain the ORIGINAL INTENT as described above
- Do NOT rewrite the entire logic unless absolutely necessary
- Make MINIMAL, TARGETED changes to fix each error
- Preserve the original code structure and design

=== INPUT 3: WARNINGS (Should Be Addressed) ===

=== SYSTEMATIC REPAIR APPROACH ===
For EACH error in the Error Log:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Identify the exact location (line number, type, member)
3. Determine the root cause (missing import, wrong type, typo, etc.)
4. Apply the MINIMAL fix needed to resolve it
5. Verify the fix doesn't break other code

=== REPAIR CHECKLIST ===
☐ All required using statements present?
☐ Namespace declaration correct?
☐ All type names spelled correctly and match exactly?
☐ All required properties and methods implemented?
☐ Method signatures correct (parameters, return types)?
☐ Access modifiers appropriate?
☐ No typos in member names?
☐ All dependencies correctly referenced?

=== CRITICAL REMINDER ===
- This code has failed validation {attempt + 1} times
- EVERY error in the Error Log MUST be fixed
- Make MINIMAL changes - don't rewrite unnecessarily  
- The repaired code MUST compile and validate successfully
- Previous repair attempts were insufficient - be MORE THOROUGH

Generate the COMPLETELY REPAIRED code now. Return ONLY the corrected C# code without any markdown formatting or explanations.";
